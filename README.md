# Why we cerated this app

We created this app to show what we learned through our class such as React.js, Typescript for frontend, Node.js for Backend and Postgres for Database.

# Language and Libraries

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Material UI
- Framer Motion(Animation)
- Node.js/express
- PostgresSQL
- Sequelize
- Heroku
- Supabase(Image storing and database hosting)

React.js is a JavaScript library, the most popular one nowadays. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications efficiently.

We use Material UI for styling because it provides us a pre-built UI component make us able to finish design quickly.

For a server-side, we use Node.js that allows us to use JavaScript which we use for frontend as well.
We especially work with Express.js framework.

For storing our data, we use PostgresSQL which we mainly obtained from the class.

We deploy both client-side and server-side on the Heroku.
They are deployed on the same server.

# UI design
